# Lean Mapper

Lean Mapper is a tiny ORM based on the powerful
[Dibi database abstraction library](https://dibiphp.com).

This is a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/Tharos/LeanMapper),
based on version v2.3.
This fork is committed to avoid breaking compatibility.

No new features---just optimizations and bug fixes.
